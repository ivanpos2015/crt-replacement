create periodic sampler to get the data rate
ex of a sample every second, with 8 samples:
10
5
3
10
10
10
5
9
which makes the data rate: (10+5+3+10+10+10+5+9)/8 = 7.75

then when you push a new value, ex 8, you remove the first value from the list(which in this case the value is 10).
so the new table becomes:
5
3
10
10
10
5
9
8
which makes the data rate: (5+3+10+10+10+5+9+8)/8 = 7.50
